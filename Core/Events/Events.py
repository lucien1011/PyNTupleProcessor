class Events(object):
    """An iterative object for events.

    You can use this class to iterate over entries in a ROOT TTree.

    You can instantiate this class with a TTree object and an
    optionally a maximum number of entries to loop over::

        inputFile = ROOT.TFile.Open(inputPath)
        tree = inputFile.Get(treeName)
        events = Events(tree)

    Then, the "for" loop for the tree entries can be::

        for event in events:

    Note: "event" and "events" are the same object. In each iteration,
    "event" (and "events") is loaded with the next entry in the tree.

    A content of the tree, e.g., a branch, can be accessed as an
    attribute of "event"::

          event.jet_pt

    In order to access to a particular entry, you can use an index.
    For example, to get 11th entry (the index for the first entry is
    0)::

        event = events[10]

    Note: Again "event" and "events" are the same object.
